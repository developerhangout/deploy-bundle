	<h1>Developer Hangout Seeking Work Policy</h1>
	<h2>Developer Hangout does not permit or endorse "looking to hire" or "position wanted" posts</h2>
	<p>
		Looking to hire a dev? Or are you trying to pay someone to help you code?
		Because of how many issues this can cause, we don't allow hiring/payment to be discussed in this server. If you need
		to hire a dev, Developer Hangout is not the place to look.
	</p>
	<h2>Why?</h2>

	<p>
		It's very easy to scam online. We simply aren't trying to deal with situations where a user isn't getting paid for their work.
	</p>

	<p>
		Don't get scammed or used
		If you see someone posting that they are lookin got hire a dev or willing to pay for help, this should be a red
		flag. This is a discord community focused around developers looking to better their skills. The majority of our user
		base are newer devs who are just beginning to learn. Most haven't had a real client before, most are working in the
		field and most having been paid to code.
	</p>
	<p>
		Anyone who is trying to hire a developer from this server is looking for cheap help or trying to scam. There are
		better places to hire a developer. Another huge red flag is if the details can only be discussed in a DM (direct
		message). This makes it easier for a scammer to be successful, as there won't be anyone else reading the
		conversation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please value your time and don't allow yourself to be used/scammed. You are spending a lot of time, money and
		resources learning how to become a programmer. This is a valuable skill and there are a ton of people who will
		take advantage of newer devs. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact a staff
		member.
	</p>
