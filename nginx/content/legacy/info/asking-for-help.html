	<h1>Asking for Help</h1>
	<h2>Do you have an issue with your code/project?</h2>
	<p>
		Always post your question in the relevant Coding Clinic channel. For example, a JavaScript question would go in the
		vanilla JavaScript channel.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you're using a framework or library but we don't have a channel for it, just post in the most relevant vanilla
		channel. Wordpress, for example, would go in vanilla PHP.
	</p>
	<p>
		The best way to get help is to ask your question while providing as many details and information as possible.
	</p>
	<h2>Tips for improving your question:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't ask if you can ask a question, just ask the original question</li>
		<li>Provide as much code as possible. Use GitHub or Hastebin</li>
		<li>Be clear about what you have tried, and errors you get</li>
		<li>Try to list the version number of relevant tools and the OS</li>
	</ul>
